<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when we collect, use, and share your information across our websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons, embeds, ads, and our other covered services that link to this Policy (collectively, the “Services”), and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us information when you use our Services on the web, via SMS, or from an application from any QmeLocal powered environment. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, storage, disclosure, and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. This includes any information you choose to provide that is deemed sensitive under applicable law.</p>

<p>When this policy mentions “we” or “us,” it refers to the controller of your information under this policy. If you live in the United States, your information is controlled by MyQme LLC, 1201 Orange St.Suite 814 Wilmington, Delaware USA </p>

<p>You alone control and are responsible for the content you submit through the Services, as provided in the Terms of Service and QmeLocal Rules.
Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize us to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection laws and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live. </p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p><strong>Basic Account Information: </strong>If you choose to create an QmeLocal account through QmeLocal.com or on a “Powered by QmeLocal” environment, you must provide us with some personal information, such as your name, business name, business address, password, email address, or phone number. On QmeLocal, your name and business name are always listed publicly, including on your profile page and in search results, and you can use either your real name or a pseudonym. Some of our features, such as searching and viewing public QmeLocal user profiles, do not require you to create an account.</p>

<p><strong>Contact Information:</strong> You may use your contact information, such as your email address or phone number, to customize your account or enable certain account features, for example, for login verification for QmeLocal via SMS. If you provide us with your phone number, you agree to receive text messages to that number from us. We may use your contact information to send you information about our Services, to market to you, to help prevent spam, fraud, or abuse, and to help others find your account, including through third-party services and client applications. You may use your settings for email and mobile notifications to control notifications you receive from QmeLocal. You may also unsubscribe from a notification by following the instructions contained within the notification or the instructions on our website. Your account settings control how others can find you on QmeLocal.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may choose to provide us with additional information to help improve and personalize your experience across our Services.  We may later personalize content, such as making suggestions based on imported information provided by you. If you email us, we may keep your message, email address, and contact information to respond to your request. If you connect your account on our Services to your account on another service, the other service may send us information that you authorize for use in the Services. This information may enable us to crosspost or otherwise help us improve the Services, and is deleted from our Services within a few weeks of your disconnecting from our Services your account on the other service.</p>

<p><strong>Displaying and Handling Public Information: </strong> Most of the information you provide us through QmeLocal is information you are asking us to make public. Our default is almost always to make the information you provide through the Services public for as long as you do not delete it, but we generally give you settings or features to make information more private if you want. If you provide us with profile information and you don’t see a visibility setting, that information is public.</p>

<p><strong>Links:</strong> We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies: </strong>A cookie is a small data file that is transferred to your computer or mobile device.  Like many websites, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at public user profiles. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, some browsers’ settings can be modified to decline cookies or alert you when a website is attempting to place a cookie on your computer. However, some Services may not function properly if you disable cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Using Our Services:</strong> We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact with our Services, even if you have not created an account (“Log Data”). For example, when you visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email notifications, use your account to authenticate to a third-party website, application, or service, or visit a third-party website, application, or service that includes QmeLocal content, we may receive information about you. This Log Data may include your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including device and application IDs), search terms, or cookie information. We also receive Log Data when you click on, view or interact with links on our Services, including links to third-party applications, such as when you choose to install another application through QmeLocal. We use Log Data to make inferences, like what topics you may be interested in, and to customize the content we show you, including ads. We keep Log Data as needed for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, email address, or phone number, after a maximum of 18 months, if not sooner</p>.

<p><strong>QmeLocal for Web Data:</strong> We may personalize the Services for you based on your visits to third-party websites that integrate QmeLocal content. When you view our content on these websites, we may receive Log Data that includes the web page you visited. We never associate this web browsing history with your name, email address, or phone number, and we delete, obfuscate, or aggregate it after no longer than 30 days. We may use interests or other information that we derive from this data to improve our Services and personalize content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow, advertising, and other content you may be interested in.</p>

<p><strong>Advertising:</strong> Our Services are supported by advertising. We may use the information described in this Privacy Policy to help make our advertising more relevant to you, to measure its effectiveness, and to help recognize your devices to serve you ads on and off of QmeLocal. Our QmeLocal Prohibited Content Policy prohibits advertisers from targeting ads based on categories we consider sensitive, such as race, religion, politics, sex life, or health. QmeLocal adheres to the Digital Advertising Alliance Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising (also referred to as “interest-based advertising”). We will not use information from the browser (and for logged in users, the account) on which you opt out for interest-based advertising, and that browser or account will not be eligible to receive interest-based ads from QmeLocal.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</strong> We may receive information about you from third parties, such as other QmeLocal users, partners (including ad partners), or our corporate affiliates. For example, other users may share or disclose information about you, such as when they mention you or share media that has you in it. Our ad partners and affiliates may share information with us such as a browser cookie ID, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of an email address, as well as demographic or interest data and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, may enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology.</p>

<p><strong>Personalizing Across Your Devices: </strong>When you log into your account with a browser or device, we will associate that browser or device with your account for purposes such as authentication and personalization. Depending on your settings, we may also personalize your experience on, and based on information from, other browsers or devices besides the ones you use to log into QmeLocal. For example, if you visit websites with sports content on your laptop, we may show you sports-related ads on QmeLocal for Android.</p>

<h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

<p>User Consent or Direction: We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you authorize a third-party web client or application to access your account or when you direct us to share your feedback with a business. When you sign up for or log in to a third-party application, you are directing us to share your contact information, such as your phone number, with that application. If you’ve shared information with another user who accesses QmeLocal through a third-party service, keep in mind that the information may be shared with the third-party service.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers: </strong>We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States, Pakistan, and other countries. For example, we use a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google Analytics. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions. </p>

<p><strong>Law and Harm: </strong>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Privacy Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect our or our users’ rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to a third party, including a government’s request to disclose your information.</p>

<p><strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates: </strong>In the event that we are involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity. We may also disclose information about you to our corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the delivery of ads.</p>

<p><strong>Non-Personal, Aggregated, or Device-Level Information:</strong> We may share or disclose non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information such as the total number of times people engaged with your content, the number of users who clicked on your content, the characteristics of a device or its user when it is available to receive an ad, the topics that people are creating content about in a particular location, or aggregated or device-level reports to advertisers about users who saw or clicked on their ads. This information does not include your name, email address, or phone number. We may, however, share non-personal, aggregated, or device-level information through partnerships with entities that may use data in their possession (including data you may have given them) to link your name, email address, or other personal information to the information we provide them. These partnerships require that they get your consent before doing so. 
</p>
<h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>
<p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information.  If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Effective: January 1st, 2020.</p>
